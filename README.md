## Run the System

We can easily run the whole with only a single command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Docker will pull the MySQL and Node.js images (if our machine does not have it before).

The services can be run on the background with command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Stop the System

Stopping all the running containers is also simple with a single command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```
